![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/unikraft/kraftkit)

KraftKit provides a suite of tools and Go-based framework for building custom, minimal, immutable lightweight unikernel virtual machines based on [Unikraft](https://unikraft.org): a fast, secure and open-source library operating system.

With KraftKit, you can easily leverage Unikraft and manage specialized, high-performance applications at every stage of their lifecycle: from construction to production.

There are many benefits in running your application as a unikernel: for more information about [the performance of unikernels 🚀](https://unikraft.org/docs/features/performance/), [the added security 🔒](https://unikraft.org/docs/features/security/) and [a positive impact on the environment 🌱](https://unikraft.org/docs/features/green/) please [check out Unikraft's documentation][unikraft-docs] and the introductory chapters on these impacts


## Features

- 🔥 Native [Firecracker MicroVM](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) support;
- 📚 Pre-built unikernel app catalog;
- 🤹‍♀️ Daemonless unikernel VM instance manager;
- 📦 OCI packaging and distribution support;
- 🚜 ELF binary / POSIX-compatibility support;
- 🧰 Go SDK for building unikernels programmatically; and
- 🚀 _much more!_


## Installation

You can quickly and easily install KraftKit using the interactive installer.
Simply run the following command to get started:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get.kraftkit.sh | sh
```

Alternatively, you can download the binaries from the [releases pages](https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit/releases).

See [additional installation instructions](https://unikraft.org/docs/cli/install).

See also the [hacking documentation on how to build KraftKit from source](https://unikraft.org/docs/cli/hacking).


### Container build environment

KraftKit ships a container build environment which you can use instead of installing any dependencies directly on your host.
It includes the `kraft` binary as well as all the additional tools and libraries for building Unikraft unikernels.
Simply attach a working directory on your host as a mount path volume mapped to `/workspace`, e.g.:

```shell
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace --entrypoint bash kraftkit.sh/base:latest
```

The above command will drop you into a container shell.
Simply type `exit` or Ctrl+D to quit.


## Quickstart

Running unikernels with `kraft` is designed to be simple and familiar.
To test your installation of `kraft`, you can run the following:

```
kraft run unikraft.org/helloworld:latest
```

Building unikernels is also designed to be simple.
You can find some common project examples below:

## Use in GitHub Actions

KraftKit can be used to automatically build your application into a unikernel in a GitHub Actions workflow, simply `use` `unikraft/kraftkit@main`.

In the following example, a repository that has been initialized with a top-level `Kraftfile` that contains a target for qemu/x86_64 will be built every time a PR is opened, synchronized or re-opened:

```yaml
name: example

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  build:
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - uses: unikraft/kraftkit@main
      with:
        workdir: .
        kraftfile: Kraftfile
        arch: x86_64
        plat: qemu
```

For other CI's and integrations, including GitLab, check out [the getting started guide](https://unikraft.org/docs/getting-started).


## Support, Community & Meetings

If you have any further questions or need more information about KraftKit or Unikraft, please refer to [the official Unikraft documentation][unikraft-docs] or ask for help on the Unikraft community forum.

A KraftKit Working Group (WG) meets every other Wednesday at 13:00 PM (CET) on [Discord][unikraft-discord].
